# quickstart
Quickstart repo for js projects working with parcel.js

## How it works
Make sure [parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) is installed

`yarn dev` will run a development server on http://localhost:1234/ replacing the default dist/ folder with docs/

`yarn build` will run the parcel build command outputting the files to the docs/ folder
